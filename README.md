# Gutt
Gutt is a lightweight version control system built in JavaScript, inspired by Git. It tracks file changes, supports commits, and logs history using a simple CLI. Unlike Git (written in C), Gutt makes version control more accessible for JS developers. Itâ€™s an educational, lightweight alternative to understand VCS concepts.
